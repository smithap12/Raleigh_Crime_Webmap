# Raleigh_Crime_Webmap
This is a web map displaying police incidents reported in 2020 in Raleigh, North Carolina. The incident reports are categorized into 3 categories, assault, weapons violation, and other. The districts from the most recent census is also laid over the map showing the relative unemployment rate of males in the area. This is to allow map readers to see if there is any correlation between police incidents and unemployment. The districts are colored into 5 categories using an equal interval. All the data in this map was downloaded as a shapefile for City of Raleigh Open Data. The districts shapefile had to be created by overlaying a country-wide census map with a city zoning map and using an overlap tool to select the districts over Raleigh. These shapefiles were then converted into geojson files in order to be uploaded onto the map. Atom was used for all the coding of this map.
